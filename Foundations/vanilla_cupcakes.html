        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>110g butter, softened</li>
            <li>110g golden caster sugar</li>
            <li>2 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
            <li>110g self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1-2 tbsp milk, plus a little extra for the icing</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For the icing</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>125g butter, softened</li>
            <li>185g icing sugar</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>STEP 1</strong>
Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Line 12 holes in a shallow muffin tin with cupcake cases (not muffin cases). Cream the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy. Beat the eggs and vanilla in a jug, then beat into the butter mixture a little at a time.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STEP 2</strong>
Fold the flour into the mixture along with a little milk – the mixture should fall easily off a spoon. Divide the mixture between the cases, filling each one no more than half full.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STEP 3</strong>
Cook the cakes for 12-15 mins – they should be firm to the touch and slightly golden brown. Cool in the tin for 5 mins, then lift them out gently and leave to cool completely.
</p>
<p>
<strong>STEP 4</strong>
To make the icing, beat the butter until it is very soft. Beat in the icing sugar a little at a time, then beat in a splash of the milk as you need to give you a soft icing that can be piped easily. Scrape the icing into an icing bag fitted with a star nozzle. Ice the cakes in swirls, starting in the centre and working outwards.
